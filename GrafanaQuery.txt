The Query below is what I used in Grafana to pull the data from Log Analytics and build the gauge to display spend data. 

CiraltosSpend_CL |
where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h) |
top 1 by TimeGenerated desc |
project Period = Period_s
                  , Day = Day_s
                  , Budget = Budget_d
                  , PeriodSpend = Spend_d
